# Labs tasks will be added soon












## Additions 
1. **Single-Line Comments** Write a program that includes a single-line comment explaining what the code does.
  ```python
  # This program prints my name
  print("Sagar Chhabriya")
  ```

2. **Multi-Line Comments** Use multi-line comments to describe a program that calculates the area of a rectangle.
  ```python
  """
  This program calculates the area of a rectangle.
  The formula for the area is width * height.
  """
  width = 5
  height = 10
  area = width * height
  print("Area of the rectangle:", area)

  ```

3. **Commenting Out Code** Write a code snippet and comment out one line to prevent it from executing.
  ```python
  # This will print a greeting
  print("Hello, World!")
  # print("This line is commented out and won't run.")

  ```


4. **Descriptive Comments** Create a program that uses descriptive comments for each step in the code.
  ```python
  # Step 1: Define the radius
  radius = 7
  
  # Step 2: Calculate the area of the circle
  area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
  
  # Step 3: Print the result
  print("Area of the circle:", area)

  ```

5. **Using Comments for To-Do Notes** Write a program and add comments to indicate tasks that need to be completed.
  ```python
  # TODO: Add input for the user's name
  name = "Sagar Chhabriya"
  
  # TODO: Change the greeting message
  print("Hello,", name)

  ```

6. **Commenting Best Practices** Create a simple program and apply best practices for commenting, including clarity and conciseness.
  ```python
  # Calculate the total price after tax
  price = 100  # Original price in dollars
  tax_rate = 0.05  # Tax rate of 5%
  total_price = price + (price * tax_rate)  # Total price calculation
  print("Total price after tax:", total_price)


  ```
